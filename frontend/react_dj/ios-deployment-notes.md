# iOS Deployment Considerations for AICO Music

## HTTP Usage and App Store Submission

### Current Configuration
The app is currently configured to connect to `http://aico-music.com`. This requires special configuration in the iOS app to allow non-secure HTTP connections through App Transport Security (ATS).

### App Store Considerations
Apple has strict requirements regarding the use of HTTPS:

1. **App Store Review**: Apple may reject apps that use HTTP instead of HTTPS without proper justification.

2. **Required Justification**: If you need to maintain HTTP for your backend, you'll need to provide a justification during the App Store submission process explaining why HTTPS cannot be used.

3. **Recommended Solution**: The best approach is to migrate your backend to HTTPS before submitting to the App Store.

## Migrating to HTTPS

### Benefits
- Improved security for your users
- Easier App Store approval process
- Better compatibility with modern web and mobile standards
- Protection of user data during transmission

### Steps to Migrate
1. Obtain an SSL certificate (you can use Let's Encrypt for free certificates)
2. Configure your web server (Nginx, Apache, etc.) to use HTTPS
3. Update the Capacitor configuration to use HTTPS:
   ```typescript
   server: {
     androidScheme: 'https',
     iosScheme: 'https',
     hostname: 'aico-music.com',
     url: 'https://aico-music.com'
   }
   ```
4. Remove the ATS exceptions from Info.plist

## Other iOS-Specific Considerations

### App Icons and Launch Screens
- You'll need to provide proper app icons in various sizes
- Create a launch screen that matches your app's branding

### Push Notifications
- If you plan to implement push notifications, you'll need to configure:
  - Apple Push Notification service (APNs)
  - Push notification certificates in your Apple Developer account

### In-App Purchases
- If you plan to offer premium features, you'll need to configure in-app purchases in App Store Connect

### TestFlight
- Consider using TestFlight for beta testing before submitting to the App Store
- Invite testers to try your app and provide feedback

### App Store Optimization
- Create compelling screenshots and app descriptions
- Choose appropriate keywords for better discoverability
